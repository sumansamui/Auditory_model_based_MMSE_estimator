# Auditory_model_based_MMSE_estimator
A denoising algorithm/ Speech Enhancement method


 Auditory-model based Bayesian estimator for Speech enhancement
 
 This function implements an audio denoising algorithm based o paramaterized 
 Bayesian estimator. The parameters The parameters of the estimator are chosen 
 based on the human auditory characteristics such as the cochleaâ€™s dynamic
 compressive non-linearity and loudness perception theory. It uses an unbiased 
 MMSE-Based Noise Power Estimation with Low Complexity and Low Tracking Delay
   
 This function takes noisy audio file as input and generates an enhanced audio file.  

 Usage:  Auditory_MMSE_STSA_unbiased_ne(noisyFile,enhancedFile,alpha,beta)
 
 
 - To run:
 
 run the program demo_process_file.m
